* 1 Data Model (let's say Customer with name, email, phone number, and total sales)
* Build a Spring web app that lets me add / update and delete Customer records, and then show a report of the top 5 customers by sales
* Ideally with Bootstrap CSS 
* Secured with Forms Login (user can be hard coded for the demo)
